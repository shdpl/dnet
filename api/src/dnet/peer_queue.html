<dl><dt><big>class <u>PeerQueue</u>;
</big></dt>
<dd>Utility used to translate data you want to send into raw UDP packets &amp; decrypts received UDP packets to data you can read.
 It takes care of packet reliability and ordered sending.
<br><br>
This class is not sockets or thread related.
 It doesn't binds, sends or receives any network data.
 It only manipulates char arrays.

<br><br>
<b>TODO:</b><br>
split larger data to chunks and send in separate packets, limit packet size
<br><br>

<dl><dt><big>void <u>put</u>(char[] <i>data</i>, bool <i>reliable</i>);
</big></dt>
<dd>Writes <i>data</i> packet you want to send to other end.
	Packet can be <i>reliable</i> if you want, meaning it will get there and in same order you send it.
	If not, it might get on destination, might not, or in unknown order.
	
<br><br>

</dd>
<dt><big>char[] <u>get</u>();
</big></dt>
<dd>Reads data packet in same order as received from other end.
        When there are no more left empty string is returned.
        
<br><br>

</dd>
<dt><big>void <u>packetPut</u>(char[] <i>data</i>);
</big></dt>
<dd>Decodes recieved raw UDP packet addressed to this end of peer.
	It translates it to <i>data</i> you can read with get() method.
	
<br><br>

</dd>
<dt><big>char[] <u>packetGet</u>();
</big></dt>
<dd>Returns raw UDP packet ready for you to transmit it to other end.
	This packet is encrypted data you have written with put() method.
	
<br><br>

</dd>
<dt><big>char[] <u>toString</u>();
</big></dt>
<dd>Use for quick debug description of object (packet id's, number of packets received, waiting etc.).
