Something you wouldn't guess:
Run build_all.sh (or .bat) to build all examples and tests.
You'll need BUD (build) utility for that on your path.

Building on linux is same as on Windows.

Folders:
	- tests (working code used during development and as examples)
	- api (updated on each build_all.bat)
	- src (pure gold, baby)
		- dnet
		- dogslow
