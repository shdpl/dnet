Something you wouldn't guess:
Run build_all.sh (or .bat) to build all examples and tests.
You'll need BUD (build) utility for that on your path.

Folders:
	- examples (stuff that aint working yet-it will be done on first release)
	- tests (working code used during development)
	- api (updated on each build_all.sh/.bat)
	- src (pure gold, baby)
		- dnet (working code)
		- dogslow (not working yet)
