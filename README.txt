== Quick start ==

Run build_all.bat from main folder (you'll need bud) to build binaries 
and generate api docs.

Check tests folder for example code & binaries.
Check api folder for docs.

== Slow start ==

Same as Quick +
Building on linux is same as on Windows. 
If you use linux then you are probably qualified to compile all this withouth script.

Folders:
	- examples (examples, tests, code for development purpose)
	- api (ddoc generated api)
	- src (pure gold, baby)
		- dnet
		- dogslow


== Help !!!!! ==

dnet low layer is simple enough. Look at api folder.
dogslow layer is bit more complicated. That is why you have tutorial included.
